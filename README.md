# Maya Scene Converter

#### Work in progress

Maya Scene Converter is a python-based Qt tool for converting scenes
from a render engine to another in Maya, it is not a perfect conversion and it depends on rules files
and how good they are but gives you a great head start.


## Features 

* Creates rules to convert from a source render engine to a target render engine
* Easy UI to create, save and load the rules
* Supports all shading related nodes: Materials,Textures,Utilities and Lights
* Converts all the scene or selected objects
* Scans the scene for any node or only what belongs to the source engine
* Some ready examples of rules files (not very precise but very functional)
* Prints info about all conversions
* Tested with Windows only but could work on other operating systems
* Tested with Maya 2018+ but could work on previous versions
